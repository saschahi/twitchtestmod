Project-T Addon: Viewershop

With Viewershop, you can let your Twitch-Viewers in on the gamplay!
Viewershop allows your Viewers to spend their Project-T Coins on Items, Buffs, or NPCs!

Items will be spawned directly on the player
NPCs will be spawned about 2/3 of the screen above the player with a random offset to the left/right
Buffs will be bought and applied "per second"

The Price of Items/NPCs is automatically generated and Items and NPCs from other mods are automatically buyable too!

Buffs currently have to be manually added (but most vanilla buffs have been manually added by me already)

Configurable Commands this Mod adds:
!buy (NPC/Item/Buff) (Amount/seconds) - Buy stuff
!purchaselist - send a link in chat to a URL (defaults to a Vanilla Pricelist witout modded items)

It's highly configurable too!
you don't want people to buy Items because it would be too easy? disable them
you want people to only be able to buy a few specific NPCs/Items? also doable
you just want buffs to be buyable? sure thing
and far more!

you can change the prices of all Items/NPCs/Buffs here:
%User%\Dokuments\My Games\Terraria\ModLoader\TProject\Shop
I'll try to add a nicer way to edit prices in the future

This Is made as an example for an Addon to Project-T, my Twitch-connection library Mod.
